# Introduction #

Wireplant exists to create a low-cost, high-efficiency method of plant horticulture using easily available materials.

# Details #

Our vision for Wireplant is to continue to experiment with construction and horticultural methods until Wireplant is an easily adaptable system for nearly any small-scale agricultural needs, at a cost far lower than current commercially available systems. Additionally, we plan to produce and develop Wireplant so that it has the flexibility necessary to grow multiple types of plants, requiring different levels of care, with only one system, allowing you to experiment with new plants without jeopardizing existing plants.
